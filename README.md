# SecureBackup

This is a very simple tool for backing up your files securely with password. It is recommended that you install and place this program onto a USB drive for better safety for your backups, so just in case your PC won't work then your files are still safe. I made this project just for the learning experience and any contributions will be helpful thanks!
